This project try to simplify the steps to add Python to Xcode 4.

For Xcode 4.3 or later, copy the Python 2 and Python 3 directories to "Path/To/Xcode/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/Mac/Others/"; for 4.2 and earlier, copy to "/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/Mac/Others/", 
then you can new a python project with Xcode.

The only thing you need to configure it manually is the Scheme. You can refer the readme.txt in your new python project to done it.
